## Project Overview

This project was undertaken soon after I graduated and right before I started my first data analyst job. The project focuses on the analysis of an online survey of tech job salaries across Ireland/Northern Ireland. The objective was to get a deeper understanding of potential salary progression as a data analyst, while also seeing if there were any standout career paths that had higher financial payoffs.
